> Targeted Learning and Variable Importance with Optimal Individualized Categorical Treatment

__Authors:__ [Ivana Malenica](https://github.com/podTockom), [Jeremy R. Coyle](https://github.com/jeremyrcoyle) and [Mark J. van der Laan](https://vanderlaan-lab.org/)

## Description

`tmle3mopttx` estimates the optimal individualized treatment rule for the categorical treatment using the modern implementation of the Super Learner algorithm ([sl3](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3)) and [tmle3](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3) [@vdl2007super]. In order to avoid nesting cross-validation, it relies on split-specific estimates of $Q$ ($\mathbb{E}(Y|A,W)$) and $g$ (($P(A|W)$)) in order to estimate the rule as described by Coyle et al [@jeremythesis]. In addition, it provides the Targeted Maximum Likelihood estimates of the mean performance using CV-TMLE under the estimated rules. This is an adapter package for use with the `tmle3` framework and the tlverse software ecosystem for Targeted Learning.
