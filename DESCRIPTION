Description: This package estimates the optimal individualized treatment rule for the categorical treatment
  using Super Learner (sl3). In order to avoid nesting cross-validation, it uses split-specific estimates 
  of Q and g to estimate the rule as described by Coyle et al. In addition it provides the Targeted Maximum
  Likelihood estimates of the mean performance using CV-TMLE under such estimated rules. This is an 
  adapter package for use with the tmle3 framework and the tlverse software ecosystem for Targeted Learning.
